<h1>Benefits of Pregnancy Exercise for Moms</h1>
<p>For all of your adult life, you’ve probably been aware that exercising — whether that means a yoga class,
     bike ride or run — can help you keep the pounds off and help prevent diseases like type 2 diabetes.
     During pregnancy, there are even more reasons to keep moving — or get moving, even if you haven’t had an exercise routine in the past.</p>
     <h2>Exercising during pregnancy has been found to:</h2>
     <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
     <li><h3>Reduce risk of pregnancy complications:</h3> </li> 
     <p>In a 2017 study, women who participated in fitness programs were less likely to develop
          gestational diabetes and less likely to have unplanned cesarean sections than those who didn’t exercise.</p>  
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Lower odds of delivery complications:</h3> </li> 
        <p>In another study on women in Spain, women who exercised three times a week gained less weight during pregnancy and were less likely to have macrosomic 
            babies (or babies weighing more than about nine pounds at birth).
            Having a heavier baby, in turn, can lead to complications for both mother and baby during delivery. </p>  
       </ul>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Speed post-delivery recovery:</h3> </li> 
        <p>The more you increase your pregnancy fitness, the faster you'll recover physically after childbirth,the more fit you'll be after delivery. In a 2012 study,
             women who exercised recovered faster after labor (even after controlling for delivery method), resuming household chores faster than  those who didn’t exercise. </p>  
       </ul>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Boost your mood:</h3> </li> 
        <p>Women are more susceptible than ever to depression during pregnancy, with an estimated one in two of all women reporting increased depression or anxiety while they’re expecting. 
           But research has found that exercise during pregnancy reduces depression, releasing endorphins that help improve mood while diminishing stress and anxiety.</p>  
       </ul>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Lower blood pressure:</h3> </li> 
        <p>Blood pressure occasionally does go up during pregnancy, but too much and
           it can be a warning sign of preeclampsia. Staying active — in one study, simply walking regularly — has been found to keep blood pressure from rising.</p>  
       </ul>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Ease back and pelvic pain:</h3> </li> 
        <p> It’s no secret that your growing baby bump puts extra pressure on your lower half, resulting in lower back pain and an achy pelvis.
             Exercising, however, may result in less lower-back and pelvic pain during late pregnancy.</p>  
       </ul>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Fight fatigue:</h3> </li> 
        <p>  Low-level tiredness plagues many women during the first trimester, then again late in the third trimester. While it seems paradoxical, sometimes getting too much rest can actually make you feel more pooped.
             So while you should never push yourself to exhaustion, a little nudge — say, an easy walk or try a prenatal yoga class — can make a big difference in your energy level.</p>  
       </ul>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Improve sleep:</h3> </li> 
        <p> While many pregnant women report having a harder time falling asleep, those who exercise consistently (as long as it's not near bedtime, 
            which can be too energizing) say the quality of their sleep is better and that they wake up feeling more rested.</p>  
       </ul>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><h3>Relieve constipation:</h3> </li> 
        <p> An active body encourages active bowels. Some women swear by a brisk 30-minute walk to keep them regular, 
            while others say even a 10-minute stroll helps get things going.</p>  
       </ul>
       <h1>Benefits of Pregnancy Exercise for Babies</h1>
       <p>The benefits of walking, swimming or dancing during pregnancy don’t end with keeping your own body healthy. While research is still ongoing, small studies on humans are beginning to confirm what’s seen in the animal studies: Exercise is just as good for your baby as it is for you for years to come.
           Most of the initial studies on the long-term effects of mom’s workout routine have been done on rats and mice — but the results are promising for humans, too.</p>
           <h2>A few of the potential benefits of exercising during pregnancy for your baby:</h2>
           <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li><h3>Reduced odds of diabetes:</h3> </li> 
            <p>One study found that rats born to exercising moms had better insulin sensitivity, even once they were adults themselves.</p>  
           </ul>
           <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li><h3>Boost to brain health:</h3> </li> 
            <p>Another study looking at pregnant mice given exercise wheels showed that the offspring of
                 more active mice were less prone to neurodegeration (the changes in the brain that can lead to Alzheimer’s disease).</p>  
           </ul>
           <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li><h3>Lower BMI:</h3> </li> 
            <p>When mice exercised during pregnancy, researchers found that their babies were less prone to obesity and diabetes. What's more, 
                they saw the same effect even if the mothers ate a high-fat diet — cancelling out any negative effects that an unhealthy diet alone would have caused.</p>  
           </ul>
           <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li><h3>A fitter heart: </h3> </li> 
            <p>One group of researchers looking at human babies discovered that a regular workout routine during pregnancy helped lower the heart rate of the fetuses at 36 weeks gestation (a good thing, since a higher heart rate can be a sign of fetal distress). In 2014, 
               they followed up that study of babies until at 1 month old and found the effects of mom’s exercising could still be seen in the babies’ heart rates after birth.</p>  
           </ul>

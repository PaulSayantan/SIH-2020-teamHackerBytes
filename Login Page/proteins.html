<h1>Food sources of protein</h1>
<p>Beans are a great source of protein, as are lean meat, poultry, fish and shellfish, eggs, milk, cheese, tofu, and yogurt. Although animal products contain complete proteins (all nine amino acid components) and plant sources generally don't, eating a variety of foods throughout the course of the day will help ensure that you get all of the amino acids you need.
    Eat three or four servings of protein daily, and you'll be well on your way to eating right for a healthy pregnancy and baby. (Seventy grams of protein roughly equals the total of two 8-ounce glasses of milk, a 5-ounce chicken breast, and one 7-ounce container of non-fat Greek yogurt, for example.)

    <h5>Caution:</h5>
    <p>Not all fish are considered safe during pregnancy.
         Some predator fish – particularly shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish – should be avoided because they contain methyl mercury, a metal believed to be harmful in high doses to the growing brains of fetuses and young children.
          The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that you eat 8 to 12 ounces of other fish during pregnancy.</p>
